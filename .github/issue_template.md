<!-- Getting "No ViewManager defined for class X" error most likely means that you didn't link the module or something is wrong with your build and/or configuration. Try cleaning the project and check if your configuration matches with https://github.com/iyegoroff/react-native-text-gradient/blob/master/manual_installation.md instruction. -->
